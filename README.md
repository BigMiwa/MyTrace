# MyTrace 
### “The Internet Never Forgets”
## Overview 
MyTrace is a privacy insight and control dashboard that helps users **track, understand, and manage their digital footprint**. 
It visualizes where your personal data lives online, what is publicly visible, and how exposed you are empowering users to take ownership of their digital presence.

## How It Works 
**Sign-Up:** Users create an account using Google or email. 
**Account Scan:** MyTrace connects to the user’s Gmail or Google linked accounts (social platforms, browsers, and old apps) using secure API integrations. 
**Footprint Visualization:** It builds an **interactive web of footprints** from social media posts to hidden trackers and third party data leaks. 
**Trace Reports:** Users receive detailed reports showing:
What data is public 
Where it’s stored 
Exposure and risk score 
**Recommended Actions:** MyTrace suggests next steps such as deleting unused accounts, revoking app access, or updating privacy settings.

## Core Features 
**Digital Footprint Map:** Interactive graph showing where your data exists across the web. 
**Privacy Health Score:** Rates your overall digital exposure based on account visibility and leaks. 
**Trace Alerts:** Sends real time notifications when your data appears in a new database or breach. 
**AI Privacy Coach:** Offers personalized advice to reduce exposure and strengthen privacy settings. 
**Trace Vault:** Securely stores and tracks deleted or cleaned-up accounts for future monitoring. 

## Why It Matters 
Everyone leaves a digital trail from social media posts to old app accounts. 
Most people don’t realize how much of their data is still out there or who can access it. 
**MyTrace** transforms that invisible reality into something people can see, measure, and control. 
It enables users to move from **reacting** to data breaches to **actively managing** their digital identity.
